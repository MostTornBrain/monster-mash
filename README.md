# Monster Mash

This is an Obsidian Plugin designed to work with existing Pathfinder 2E monster
statblocks.   It provides the ability to create a new copy of a currently viewed
monster and make it "elite" or "weak" per the PF2E rules in the Monster Core.

This plug-in requires you eiter execute the command via the command window or by
creating keyboard shortcuts for the "Elite Monster Upgrade" and "Weak Monster 
Downgrade" commands.

NOTE: This plug-in assumes a well-formatted PF2E statblock.  It has been tested
with the statblocks exported from Foundry using the 
[PF2E Exporter](https://github.com/MostTornBrain/pf2e-md-exporter) module.
